## MTGTrader
This project aims to create a web based application for trading Magic the Gathering cards while learning how to use React and fastapi.

The app allows users to create an acount and upload cards from their collection that they wish to trade away. They can also list cards 
they are looking to trade for and search to see other users who have those cards. By initiating a trade with another user you can negaotiate which cards 
you have that the other wants in order to setup a mutually beneficial trade.

The backend manages a database for card entries of all users. When searching the database filters by userid, card name, price, etc to get only the relevant cards.
